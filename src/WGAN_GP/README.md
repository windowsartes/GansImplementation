# WGAN-GP
## Overview

Here you can find my [WGAN with gradient policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028) on PyTorch. 

I've trained model that was proposed in [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) paper. Here you can find my kaggle [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nikolaimakarov/wgan-gp-implementation-and-training) with training on CelebA dataset.
Since this model was trained only for 10 epochs, for sure it didn't convergence, but as you can see in wandb logs, Generater output becomes better with every epoch, so this model works.
